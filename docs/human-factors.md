# Human Factor Principles

### Human Factor Principles

Understanding and managing the following human factors can help maintain a safe work environment. Use this table as a reference to identify and mitigate risks during your daily tasks.

| **Factor**             | **Definition**                                                                                                   | **Action**                                                                                         |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Complacency**        | Overconfidence from repeated experience on a specific task.                                                      | Stay vigilant; don't let familiarity lead to mistakes.                                             |
| **Lack of Knowledge**  | Insufficient training, information, or ability to perform a task.                                                | Ask questions when unsure; use current manuals and resources.                                      |
| **Lack of Teamwork**   | Failure to collaborate effectively towards a shared goal.                                                        | Communicate clearly about tasks; ensure everyone understands and agrees on the approach.           |
| **Distraction**        | Events or conditions that interrupt focus on a task.                                                             | Use checklists; minimize interruptions to maintain concentration.                                  |
| **Fatigue**            | Physical or mental exhaustion affecting performance.                                                             | Monitor for fatigue; have peers check your work; watch for signs in yourself and others.           |
| **Hydration**          | Inadequate water intake, especially during hot conditions.                                                       | Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, particularly in hot weather.                               |
| **Lack of Resources**  | Insufficient people, equipment, documentation, or time to complete a task.                                       | Plan ahead; ensure necessary resources are available before starting a task.                       |
| **Pressure**           | High demands for performance, either real or perceived.                                                          | Communicate concerns; ask for help when needed.                                                    |
| **Lack of Assertiveness** | Hesitation to speak up about safety concerns or actions of others.                                            | Put safety first; don't hesitate to voice concerns.                                                |
| **Lack of Communication** | Ineffective communication or feedback during tasks.                                                           | Ensure clear, complete communication; avoid assumptions and verify work details.                   |
| **Norms**              | Unwritten standards or practices adopted by a group.                                                             | Adhere to safety procedures, even if existing norms suggest otherwise.                             |
| **Stress**             | Physical or mental strain from external pressures.                                                               | Approach problems rationally; take breaks when needed to manage stress.                            |
| **Lack of Awareness**  | Failure to recognize, understand, or predict hazardous conditions.                                               | Stay alert; consider the broader safety implications of your actions.                              |

By keeping these factors in mind, you can actively contribute to a safer and more effective work environment.
