# Man Overboard

### Man Overboard Procedure

In the event of a Man Overboard (MOB), it is crucial to act swiftly and calmly to ensure the safety of the individual in the water. Follow these steps:

1. **Shout “Man Overboard!”**: Immediately alert the crew and passengers to the situation.
2. **Press the MOB Button on the GPS:** This will mark the location of the incident, helping to navigate back to the point where the person went overboard.
3. **Throw a Life Buoy:** Quickly provide flotation assistance to the person in the water.
4. **Assign a Spotter:** Designate a crew member or passenger to continuously point at the MOB to maintain visual contact.
5. **Send a Distress Alert:** Issue a DSC distress alert followed by a Mayday call on channel 16 to notify nearby vessels and rescue services.
6. **Keep Pointing:** The spotter must keep pointing at the MOB and never lose sight of them.
7. **Prepare a Throwing Line:** Ready a line that can be thrown to the person in the water when close enough.
8. **Approach Safely:** The Captain will maneuver the boat alongside the MOB, ensuring the boat is pointed into the wind with the engine stopped to avoid propeller accidents.
9. **Recover the MOB:** Secure the MOB with a line and assist them back on board safely.

Following these steps ensures a coordinated and effective response to a man overboard emergency, maximizing the chances of a successful recovery.
