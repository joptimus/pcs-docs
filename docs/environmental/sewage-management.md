# Boat Sewage Management

Floating sewage is not only unsightly but also diminishes the enjoyment of boating. Federal law mandates that all boats with fixed toilets have a U.S. Coast Guard-approved Marine Sanitation Device (MSD). Holding tanks retain waste until it can be pumped into a shore-based sewer or receptacle. Direct discharge of sewage into the water, including lakes, is illegal. Any spills must be reported immediately to local authorities and management.
