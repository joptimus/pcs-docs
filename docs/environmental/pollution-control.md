# Pollution Control

Pollution affects everyone and everything we do. Even small, seemingly insignificant acts of pollution can accumulate over time, harming the environment. While marinas and boats are not major sources of pollution, they can still contribute minor pollutants. Pro Captain Staffing's policy is to actively discourage pollution and encourage responsible behavior among boaters and visitors. All employees are expected to be proactive in cleaning up, preventing contaminants from entering the water, and maintaining clean marinas and waterways.
