# Litter Control

Dumping trash and plastic into the water is illegal in most countries and goes against our environmental policies. Pro Captain Staffing's litter control measures are straightforward:

- **Overboard dumping of any trash is ILLEGAL and NOT TOLERATED.**
- **Bring back what you take out.**
- **Use marina trash receptacles for items that cannot be recycled.**
- **Keep cigarette and cigar butts out of the water.**
- **Pick up any litter you see on the water, docks, or ground for proper disposal.**
