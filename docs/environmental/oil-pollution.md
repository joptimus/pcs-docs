# Oil Pollution Prevention

While oil pollution from boats and marinas is generally minor, it can still significantly impact marine life. Even a single drop of oil can spread across the water's surface, creating a harmful sheen. U.S. law prohibits the discharge of oil or oily waste into navigable waters, with violators subject to fines. 

Pro Captain Staffing's policies on oil pollution include:

- **Overboard dumping or discharge of ANY OIL is ILLEGAL and NOT TOLERATED.**
- **Boat bilges should be equipped with oil absorption pads, replaced as necessary.**
- **Engines must be properly maintained to prevent leaks and ensure fuel efficiency.**
- **Exercise care when fueling to prevent spillage from the nozzle or air vent.**
- **Boats with built-in fuel tanks should have air vent whistles or fuel/air separators to prevent spills.**
- **All oil spills, no matter the size, must be reported to management immediately for notification to the U.S. Coast Guard.**

Maintaining high environmental standards is crucial for preserving our boating areas. By following these guidelines, we can all contribute to a cleaner, safer, and more enjoyable environment on the water.
