# Uniforms

### Uniform and Appearance Standards

While on shift, all employees must wear the proper uniform and strive to represent Pro Captain Staffing in a positive manner.

- **Uniform Shirts:** Company-provided uniform shirts must be kept clean and neat. While shirts do not need to be pressed, they should not appear as if they were taken directly from a dirty clothes pile.
  
- **Acceptable Bottoms:** 
  - Khaki shorts
  - Blue jeans
  - Khaki pants
  
  All bottoms must be clean, neat, and of an appropriate length. Clothing with holes, stains, or provocative designs is not permitted.

- **Footwear:** 
  - Deck shoes, flip-flops, and sandals are allowed. 
  - No shoes are permitted inside any salon area of the boat.

Adhering to these guidelines ensures a professional appearance and helps maintain the positive image of Pro Captain Staffing.
