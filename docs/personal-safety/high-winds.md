# High Winds Protocol

High winds pose serious safety risks while operating a vessel, including increased difficulty in navigation, reduced control of the boat, and potential hazards for passengers and crew. It is the Captain's responsibility to monitor wind and weather conditions continuously and to make informed decisions regarding the safety of ongoing trips. 

**Monitoring and Decision-Making:**

- **Captain's Responsibility:** The Captain must keep a close watch on current and forecasted wind speeds, using reliable sources such as marine weather channels, weather apps, and real-time monitoring equipment on the vessel.

- **Advising the Crew:** Captains should promptly inform all crew and passengers of impending significant weather changes or high wind conditions, ensuring that everyone is aware of the potential risks and the necessary safety measures.

- **Discretionary Winds Up to 20 MPH:** If wind speeds are forecasted or observed to be up to 20 MPH, the Captain has the discretion to decide whether to continue the trip. Factors to consider include:
  - Vessel stability and capability in windy conditions
  - The experience and comfort level of the crew and passengers
  - Proximity to safe docking locations
  - Visibility and overall weather conditions in addition to wind speed

- **Mandatory Return at 20 MPH or Greater:** If winds are forecasted or reach a sustained speed of 20 MPH or greater, all trips must immediately return to the dock unless explicitly cleared by Capt. Bob. High winds can create dangerous conditions, including large waves, difficult docking maneuvers, and compromised passenger safety.

- **Clearance from Capt. Bob:** In exceptional circumstances where Capt. Bob provides clearance, additional safety protocols must be followed. The Captain must ensure that extra precautions are in place, such as enhanced communication with the crew, securing loose equipment, and preparing all passengers with life vests and safety briefings.

**Safety First:** The overriding principle in high wind situations is the safety of the vessel, crew, and passengers. No trip is worth risking lives or property; therefore, adherence to these guidelines ensures responsible decision-making in the face of challenging weather conditions.
