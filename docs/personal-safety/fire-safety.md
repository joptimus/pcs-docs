# Fire Safety

### Fire Safety and Prevention

Operating a boat involves processes and materials that come with inherent fire risks. It is crucial to always be fire conscious and take every precaution to prevent fires. The best defense against fire is prevention. Maintain high housekeeping standards, avoid spills, and do not smoke on board. 

**What to Do if You Discover a Fire:**

- **First:** Sound the alarm to alert others in the area of the danger.
- **Call a Mayday:** Use channel 16 to call for immediate assistance.
- **Contact the Fire Department:** Dial 911 to dispatch lake firefighters.
- **Assess Your Surroundings and Safety:** Always consider your personal safety before attempting to fight the fire.
- **Fight the Fire:** Use an appropriate extinguisher, face the fire, keep an escape route, and aim at the base of the fire, sweeping from front to back.
- **Ensure Passenger Safety:** Make sure all passengers are wearing life vests.

By taking these steps, you can effectively respond to a fire emergency and help ensure the safety of everyone on board.
