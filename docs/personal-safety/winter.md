### Winter Weather Safety

During the winter months, it's important to dress appropriately and take extra precautions to protect yourself from cold, wet, and windy conditions. Follow these tips to stay safe and healthy:

- **Dress in Layers:** Layer your clothing to stay warm and dry in cold weather conditions. Proper layering helps protect against the elements.

- **Take Care of Your Health:** Avoid common winter illnesses by getting plenty of rest, and avoid exhaustion and fatigue.

- **Adjust Your Pace:** Allow extra time for tasks, even routine ones, as efficiency can decrease in colder temperatures. Do not stay outside longer than necessary to complete your work.

- **Watch for Signs of Frostbite and Hypothermia:** Be aware of symptoms such as:
  - Uncontrolled shivering
  - Slurred speech
  - Clumsy movements
  - Fatigue
  - Confused behavior

Recognizing these signs early can help prevent serious cold-related health issues.
