### Hydration and Sun Safety

Staying hydrated and protecting yourself from the sun are essential for your safety while on duty. Follow these guidelines to ensure your well-being:

- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Be vigilant for signs of heat illness, which may include:
  - Dry skin
  - Dizziness
  - Increased pulse rate
  - Headache
  - Profuse sweating

- **Avoid Sugary Drinks:** Steer clear of drinks high in sugar, such as sodas and energy drinks, as they can contribute to dehydration.

- **Sun Protection:** Always wear sunscreen with at least SPF 30. Our uniform shirts are designed with up to UPF 50 protection to help shield you from harmful sun exposure.

Prioritizing hydration and sun safety helps ensure a safe and enjoyable work environment.
