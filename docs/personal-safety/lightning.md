# Lightning Safety Protocol

Lightning is a sudden and powerful electric discharge that occurs either between clouds or from a cloud to the ground, often accompanied by bright flashes of light and the sound of thunder. Lightning is extremely dangerous and unpredictable, striking somewhere on Earth approximately 100 times every second. It is one of the leading causes of weather-related fatalities, killing more people annually than hurricanes or tornadoes. In the United States alone, lightning kills about 90 people each year.

**Understanding the Risks:**
- Lightning strikes can occur with little or no warning and can be deadly to anyone caught in open areas, including on the water.
- Boats, particularly those with tall masts or metal components, can act as conductors, significantly increasing the risk of a strike.
- Lightning can also damage equipment, start fires, and cause serious injuries to passengers and crew.

**Immediate Actions During Lightning:**
- **Return to Dock Immediately:** If lightning is detected in the area, prioritize safety by heading back to the dock as quickly and safely as possible. Do not wait for the weather to worsen; immediate action is critical.
  
- **Monitor Weather Conditions:** Continuously monitor weather updates from reliable sources such as [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov) or a trusted weather app. Staying informed about storm patterns and lightning activity is crucial for making timely decisions. The STORM app is recommended for real-time weather alerts and lightning tracking.

- **Safety on Board:** 
  - In the event of nearby lightning, instruct all passengers to stay away from metal objects, electronics, and open areas of the boat.
  - Disconnect and avoid using electrical equipment during the storm to minimize the risk of electric shock.

- **Seek Shelter:** While returning to the dock, seek shelter in a cabin or enclosed area of the vessel if possible. Avoid standing or sitting in open areas.

**Remember:** Lightning strikes are sudden and unpredictable, making them a serious threat to anyone on the water. By adhering to these safety measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of lightning-related incidents and ensure the well-being of everyone on board.
