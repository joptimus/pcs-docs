# Commitment to Safety

At Pro Captain Staffing, we are committed to being a leader in safety, recognizing that maintaining a safe operation is key to our success. Safety is our top priority and must be considered in every decision and every aspect of our company. Each of us is responsible for upholding an uncompromising commitment to safety. Our mission is to provide a safe and enjoyable day on the water for both our employees and customers.

We trust in the sound judgment and training of our experienced Captains and Mates. Being accountable to one another means promptly reporting hazards, safety concerns, and incidents to management at **682-561-5927** or via email at **office@procaptainstaffing.com**.

Thank you for all you do to promote a positive safety culture.
