- Complete three docking maneuvers before returning to the dock.

**5. Captain’s Choice**  
The final trip is tailored to the client’s specific needs based on their progress. This session can focus on additional docking practice, anchoring techniques, or exploring new areas of the lake.

**Procedure:**
- The captain decides the focus based on the client’s strengths and areas needing improvement.
- Utilize prior trip structures (Docking 101, Lake Tour) to provide additional targeted instruction.
- Finalize training by reinforcing best practices and safe handling techniques.

### Scheduling and Certification

- The first trip is scheduled by the company, while subsequent trips are arranged directly between the captain and the client.
- Upon completing the course, clients receive a letter of completion and a certificate, which may qualify them for insurance discounts. The certificate should be delivered by the captain on the final trip or provided during a follow-up visit.

### Additional Opportunities

- **Boat Delivery Trip:** Often given by boat brokers, this trip introduces new boat owners to their vessel. Captains should also promote the Boat 101 and Total Boat Management programs during these sessions.
- **Total Boat Management:** Our tailored boat management service provides ongoing support similar to yacht management, ensuring vessels remain in top condition.

This structured training approach ensures clients gain confidence and competence in all aspects of boat handling, from basic navigation to advanced docking and anchoring.
