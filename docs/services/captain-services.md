# Captain’s Services

Pro Captain Staffing offers a range of Captain’s Services to cater to our clients' boating needs. Our services ensure that each trip is safe, enjoyable, and professionally managed. Below is an overview of the services we provide, including detailed procedures and expectations for each type of trip.

### Captain for a Trip

This service involves providing a Captain to operate a client’s boat during scheduled outings, usually on Fridays or Saturdays. Most of our Total Boat Management clients utilize this service for their boating trips. Each trip has a three-hour minimum.

**Pricing:**
- Up to 42 feet: $300
- Over 42 feet: $350
- Each additional hour: $75

**Responsibilities During the Trip:**
- Ensure the boat departs and arrives safely.
- While at anchor, keep the vessel clean, monitor safety, and ensure the client has a pleasant experience.
- Preference in booking is given to Total Boat Management clients.

### Boat Load/Unload

We offer services to load or unload boats for transportation, typically for larger vessels being moved onto semi-trailers. Some trips may involve relocating a boat from one marina to another, requiring the Captain to return via Uber. All specific details and procedures will be communicated in advance.

**Pricing:**
- Boat Load: $300
- Boat Unload: $300

### Sea Trial

Upon request from local boat brokers, we provide Captains for Sea Trials during boat surveys. A Sea Trial involves taking the boat from the marina to the lake, running it from idle to cruising speed, and demonstrating its systems, such as trim tabs, electronics, and lights. The surveyor will guide the process, including checking the engine room when required. Some Sea Trials may involve out-of-water inspections, which could require loading onto a trailer or taking the boat to a haul-out location.

**Pricing:**
- Sea Trial: $200
- Sea Trial with Haul: $250
- Typical Sea Trial Duration: Up to 2 hours

### Post-Trip Reporting

After each trip, a Captain’s Trip Report is required. This report should be sent via email to captainbob@procaptainstaffing.com. Although there is no standard format, the report should provide a clear summary of the trip, including any notable events or concerns.

Following these procedures ensures consistency and excellence in our Captain’s Services, helping us maintain our reputation for safety and client satisfaction.
