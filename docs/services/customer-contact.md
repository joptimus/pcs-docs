# Customer Contact

### Customer Contact Processes

At Pro Captain Staffing, clear communication is key to ensuring a great experience for our clients. When a trip is booked, we prioritize over-communicating the trip details to meet our clients' expectations fully.

- **Booking Confirmation:** Clients will receive a confirmation that includes your picture and all trip details, along with the Terms and Conditions specific to their booking.
  
- **Captain Notification:** As the captain, you will receive an appointment with all trip details, including the clientâ€™s contact information. It is important that you reach out to the client the day before the trip to confirm the details and address any last-minute questions.

- **Post-Trip Follow-Up:** After each trip, we send a thank-you message to our customers, inviting them to provide feedback on their experience. This feedback is invaluable in helping us continually improve our services.

Maintaining proactive communication with our clients ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience on the water.
