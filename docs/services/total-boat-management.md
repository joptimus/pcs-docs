# Total Boat Management (TBM)

**Total Boat Management (TBM)** is our comprehensive boat care service, tailored specifically for our clients in North Texas. Unlike traditional yacht management, TBM is designed to meet the unique needs of local boat owners. This service was developed to assist clients in preparing their boats for upcoming trips, ensuring that each vessel is ready to depart at any time. TBM offers three levels of service: Basic, Captain’s, and Admiral’s.

### Service Levels

1. **Basic Level of Total Boat Management**
   - **Monthly Inspection**: A thorough examination of the boat’s systems and condition.
   - **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous oversight of the vessel’s status.
   - **Written Report with Photos**: Detailed reports with images documenting the boat’s condition.

2. **Captain’s Level of Total Boat Management**
   - Includes everything in the Basic Level.
   - **Fuel Ups and Pump Outs**: Fuel costs are reimbursed monthly.
   - **Bi-Monthly Checks**: Captains must check on the boat at least twice per month.

3. **Admiral’s Level of Total Boat Management**
   - Includes all services in the Basic and Captain’s Levels.
   - **Maintenance and Cleaning Management**: PCS handles all maintenance and cleaning contracts, paying the bills upfront and getting reimbursed monthly.

### Monthly Inspection Protocol

The monthly inspection is critical and must be completed before the start of the next month. Inspections should ideally occur during the same week as the previous month. A comprehensive report with photos must be generated using our designated app while on board the boat. Captains are required to check all onboard systems for proper functionality. Any non-functional items should be reported to PCS immediately and logged in the app. Reports must be completed on the same day as the inspection.

**Inspection Checklist:**
- **Safety Equipment:**
  - Verify the presence of adequate life jackets.
  - Inspect fire extinguishers to ensure they are:
    - Properly mounted.
    - Less than 12 years old.
    - Showing the gauge in the green.
    - Ensure at least two handheld fire extinguishers are on board for vessels over 25 feet.
  - Confirm the presence of a first aid kit.

- **Boat Systems:**
  - Check all navigation lights for functionality.
  - Inspect the bilge and provide a photo:
    - Check for water and remove excess if found (document in the report).
    - Check engine and generator oils, with photos of each dipstick.
    - Inspect transmission oils.
    - Run engines and generator, testing for full functionality and ensuring they reach operating temperature.
    - Top off any low fluids.
    - Capture a photo of the operating hours on each engine and generator.

  - Flush all heads and include photos in the report.
  - Fill the water tank with double-filtered water.
  - Clean the shower sump box.
  - Take additional photos of anything noteworthy for the client or PCS.

**Report Submission:**
- Ensure that the report is completed and submitted while still on the boat to avoid missing any details.

### Additional Captain Responsibilities for Captain’s and Admiral’s Levels

For boats assigned to Captains at the Captain’s or Admiral’s levels, Captains are required to visit the vessel at least twice per month to monitor its status. During these visits, check on the boat, conduct any necessary fueling or pump-out services, and document all findings.

Following these procedures ensures the highest standards of care for our clients’ vessels, keeping them in peak condition and ready for any adventure.
