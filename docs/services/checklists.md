# Checklists

Pro Captain Staffing offers three tailored services to meet our customers’ needs, including specialized Boat Handling Training. For all services, including training and captain-led trips, it is essential to follow a standardized checklist from start to finish. This ensures safety, efficiency, and the proper handling of the vessel. Below is the process for both departure and arrival procedures:

### Departure Checklist

1. **Arriving at the Vessel:**
   - Check the bilge by opening the engine hatch. Inspect for standing water, drips, and overall cleanliness.
   - Check oil levels in all engines and the generator. Explain to the client that the generator is the most used yet often neglected component.

2. **Safety Gear Check:**
   - Ensure the following safety items are on board:
     1. USCG-approved life jackets for all passengers.
     2. USCG Type IV throwable device.
     3. Fire extinguishers.
     4. First Aid Kit.
     5. Registration paperwork.
     6. **Recommended (required on navigable waters):** Signal flares.

3. **Preparation Steps:**
   - Turn on the blower and let it run for 4 minutes before starting any combustion engine, as recommended by the USCG.
   - Start the generator and confirm that water is flowing out of the exhaust.
   - Switch the power from shore to generator power:
     - Ensure the air conditioning systems are turned off at the breakers before switching power.

4. **Engine Start-Up:**
   - Start the vessel’s engines, allowing them to warm up and ensure the transmissions engage properly.
   
5. **Disconnect Shore Power:**
   - Safely disconnect shore power and store the cables on the dock.

6. **Dock Line Management:**
   - Throw lines onto the dock without allowing them to get wet.

7. **Departure:**
   - Safely depart the dock, ensuring a smooth exit.

### Arrival Checklist

1. **Securing the Vessel:**
   - Arrive safely back into the slip and attach all dock lines to secure the vessel.

2. **Power Management:**
   - Connect shore power and switch the power source from the generator back to shore power, ensuring it is functioning correctly.
     - Turn off the air conditioning systems at the breakers before switching power.

3. **Shut Down Procedures:**
   - Shut down the generator and engines only after confirming the switch to shore power.
   - Turn off all non-essential systems on both the AC and DC panels.

4. **Final Check:**
   - Ensure the boat is secure in the slip, shore power is on, and battery chargers are functioning.

5. **Wrap-Up:**
   - Ensure everything is in order, then enjoy the rest of your day!

This checklist must be followed meticulously by our captains on every trip to ensure a safe and professional boating experience.
